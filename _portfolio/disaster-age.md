Disaster Age is a TTRPG detective setting for the most played RPG in the world : Dungeons and Dragons (Fifth Edition), set in an uchronic Thedas.

A century after the events of Dragon Age : Inquisition, the infamous Organisation never disbanded following the events of Trespasser. 

This change of events allowed for a group of extremists, the *Fatalists*, to take over the Inquisition and transform it into an even more powerful international organisation. Placing themselves above the law and the states to protect Humanity, the Inquisition is led by a divine quest, and gave itself the goal to erase all magic in the world by securizing dangerous artifacts and investigating paranormal events. But in their righteous quests, the Inquisition grew uncompromising, and will treat any neutral agents as enemy.

You're playing as an Exiled : A former Inquisitor that now travel the world and investigate the magic of the world on your own account. The Inquisition searches for you, and the people of Thedas treats you with a mix of fear and anger. Accumulating Artifacts and resolving strange cases, your quest of power can only know one end : A confrontation with the Inquisition and their infamous flying capital Pelmecia. You'll certainly not survive... Or could you ?
