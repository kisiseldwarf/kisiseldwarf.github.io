Drawnation is a platformer game made in Godot, throughout a 48 hour gamejam.
Drawnation is gameplay asynchronous through one terminal : One player control the charcater, and the other draws platforms on the screen to help the little man get through the level ! As time passes, the screen shifts quicker and quicker. Touch the border, and it's game over ! How far will you get ?
