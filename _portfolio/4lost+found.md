This game was made throughout a 48 hours gamejam. I participated as a game developper.
You work for a mysterious company, Lost+Found, which objective is to retrieve lost memories within the mind.
You navigate the subconscient of your clients as you search for their lost memories - but be careful not to loose yourself in their mind.
