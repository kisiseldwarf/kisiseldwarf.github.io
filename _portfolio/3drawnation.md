Drawnation is a platformer game made in Godot, throughout a 48 hour gamejam.

Drawnation has an asynchronous gameplay : One player control the character, and the other draws platforms on the screen to help the little man get through the level ! 

As time passes, the screen shifts quicker and quicker. Touch the border, and it's game over ! How far will you get ?
