Drawnation is a platformer game made in Godot throughout a 48 hour gamejam. There, I occupied the job of a game designer, a level designer, a gameplay developer and also did the hand-style graphics.

Drawnation is a gameplay-asynchronous platformer : One player control the character, and the other draws platforms on the screen to help the little man get through the level ! 

As time passes, the screen shifts quicker and quicker. Touch the border, and it's game over ! How far will you get ?
