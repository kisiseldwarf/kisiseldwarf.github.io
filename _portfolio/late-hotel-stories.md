Late Hotel Stories is an investigation 2D game set in a Cyberpunk universe following a world apocalypse caused by the *scream*, an alien entity that killed two third of the world population. 

Humanity has found refuge in a mysterious City called Caliope, which appeared magically during the Apocalypse.

You play as Emet, a failed detective who lost his job following a strange case. Now employed by the Late Hotel, a mysterious detective agency, Emet is tasked to resolve cases for shadowy agents to pay for his rent. But the city grows werider as Emet progresses and discovers his true nature : the *prodigy of truth*.

The city may not be what it seems - What if the *scream* was our true savior ?
